# Doubly Linked Lists

Welcome to the README file for the "0x17. C - Doubly linked lists" project! In this project, we will be exploring the concept of doubly linked lists and implementing various operations on them in the C programming language. This README file will provide you with an overview of the project, its objectives, and the steps to get started.

## Introduction

A doubly linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element holds a pointer to both the next and previous elements in the list. This bidirectional linkage provides additional flexibility and enables efficient traversal in both directions.

The goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of doubly linked lists and practice their implementation in the C programming language. We will be creating a set of functions to perform various operations on doubly linked lists, such as adding, deleting, and modifying elements.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Implement the necessary data structures to represent a doubly linked list.
2. Write functions to perform operations on the doubly linked list, including:
   - Creating a new list
   - Adding elements at the beginning, end, or at a given position
   - Removing elements from the list
   - Searching for an element
   - Reversing the list
   - Printing the list
   - Freeing the memory occupied by the list
3. Test the functions thoroughly to ensure they handle different scenarios and edge cases correctly.
4. Optimize the implementation for efficiency and readability.
